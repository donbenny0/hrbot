How to Use the Local RAG Chatbot:

1. Place all your `.txt` documents inside the `docs/` directory.
2. Run the `rag_chatbot.py` script.
3. When prompted, type in a question related to the content in your documents.
4. The chatbot will retrieve the most relevant information from your documents and generate an answer using a local LLM.

Tips:
- Keep your text files well-organized and clean.
- Break long documents into paragraphs for better chunking.
- You can replace the embedding model or language model easily in the script.

Example questions:
- "What is this chatbot for?"
- "How do I add new documents?"
- "What technologies are used in this project?"
