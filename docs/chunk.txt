myself, could be housed in separate identities, life would be
relieved of all that was unbearable; the unjust might go his way,
delivered from the aspirations and remorse of his more upright
twin; and the just could walk steadfastly and securely on his
upward path, doing the good things in which he found his pleasure, and no longer exposed to disgrace and penitence by the       
hands of this extraneous evil.
  14. lt was the curse of mankind that
these incongru- ous faggots were thus bound together-that in
the agonised womb of consciousness, these polar twins should
be continuously struggling.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 684 (containing 3 segments):
  1. How, then were they dissociated?
l was so far in my reflections when, as l have said, a side light
began to shine upon the subject from the laboratory table.
  2. l
began to per- ceive more deeply than it has ever yet been
stated, the trembling im- materiality, the mistlike transience, of
this seemingly so solid body in which we walk attired.
  3. Certain
agents l found to have the power to shake and pluck back that
fleshly vestment, even as a wind might toss the curtains of a
pavilion.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 685 (containing 1 segments):
  1. For two good reasons, l will not enter deeply into this
scientific branch of my confession.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 686 (containing 1 segments):
  1. First, because l have been
made to learn that the doom and burthen of our life is bound
for ever on man's shoulders, and when the attempt is made to
83
cast it off, it but returns upon us with more unfamiliar and more
awful pressure.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 687 (containing 2 segments):
  1. Sec- ond, because, as my narrative will make,
alas! too evident, my discover- ies were incomplete.
  2. Enough
then, that l not only recognised my natu- ral body from the mere
aura and effulgence of certain of the powers
that made up my spirit, but managed to compound a drug by
which these powers should be dethroned from their supremacy,
and a sec- ond form and countenance substituted, none the less
natural to me because they were the expression, and bore the
stamp of lower ele- ments in my soul.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 688 (containing 10 segments):
  1. l hesitated long before l put this theory to the test of practice.
  2. l
knew well that l risked death; for any drug that so potently
controlled and shook the very fortress of identity, might, by the
least scruple of an overdose or at the least inopportunity in the
moment of exhibi- tion, utterly blot out that immaterial
tabernacle which l looked to it to change.
  3. But the temptation of
a discovery so singular and profound at last overcame the
suggestions of alarm.
  4. l had long since prepared my tincture; l
purchased at once, from a firm of wholesale chemists, a large
quantity of a particular salt which l knew, from my experiments,
to be the last ingredient required; and late one accursed night, l
com- pounded the elements, watched them boil and smoke
together in the glass, and when the ebullition had subsided, with
a strong glow of courage, drank off the potion.
  5. 84
The most racking pangs succeeded: a grinding in the bones,
deadly nausea, and a horror of the spirit that cannot be
exceeded at the hour of birth or death.
  6. Then these agonies
began swiftly to subside, and l came to myself as if out of a
great sickness.
  7. There was something strange in my sensations,
something indescribably new and, from its very nov- elty,
incredibly sweet.
  8. l felt younger, lighter, happier in body; within l
was conscious of a heady recklessness, a current of disordered
sensual images running like a millrace in my fancy, a solution of
the bonds of obligation, an unknown but not an innocent
freedom of the soul.
  9. l knew myself, at the first breath of this new
life, to be more wicked, tenfold more wicked, sold a slave to my
original evil; and the thought, in that moment, braced and
delighted me like wine.
  10. l stretched out my hands, exulting in the
freshness of these sensations; and in the act, l was suddenly
aware that l had lost in stature.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 689 (containing 3 segments):
  1. There was no mirror, at that date, in my room; that which stands
beside me as l write, was brought there later on and for the very
pur- pose of these transformations.
  2. The night however, was far
gone into the morning-the morning, black as it was, was nearly
ripe for the conception of the day-the inmates of my house
were locked in the
most rigorous hours of slumber; and l determined, flushed as l
was with hope and triumph, to venture in my new shape as far
as to my bedroom.
  3. l crossed the yard, wherein the constellations
85
looked down upon me, l could have thought, with wonder, the
first creature of that sort that their unsleeping vigilance had yet
disclosed to them; l stole through the corridors, a stranger in my
own house; and coming to my room, l saw for the first time the
appearance of Edward Hyde.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 690 (containing 1 segments):
  1. l must here speak by theory alone, saying not that which l know,
but that which l suppose to be most probable.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 691 (containing 2 segments):
  1. The evil side of
my nature, to which l had now transferred the stamping
efficacy, was less robust and less developed than the good
which l had just deposed.
  2. Again, in the course of my life, which
had been, after all, nine tenths a life of effort, virtue and control,
it had been much less exercised and much less exhausted.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 692 (containing 1 segments):
  1. And
hence, as l think, it came about that Edward Hyde was so much
smaller, slighter and younger than Henry Jekyll.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 693 (containing 3 segments):
  1. Even as good
shone upon the countenance of the one, evil was written
broadly and plainly on the face of the other.
  2. Evil besides (which l
must still believe to be the lethal side of man) had left on that
body an imprint of deformity and decay.
  3. And yet when l looked
upon that ugly idol in the glass, l was conscious of no
repugnance, rather of a leap of wel- come.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 694 (containing 3 segments):
  1. This, too, was
myself.
  2. lt seemed natural and human.
  3. ln my eyes it bore a
livelier image of the spirit, it seemed more express and single,
than the imperfect and divided countenance l had been hitherto
ac- customed to call mine.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 695 (containing 3 segments):
  1. And in so far l was doubtless right.
  2. l
have observed that when l wore the semblance of Edward Hyde,
none could come near to me at first without a visible misgiving
86
of the flesh.
  3. This, as l take it, was because all human beings, as
we meet them, are com- mingled out of good and evil: and
Edward Hyde, alone in the ranks of mankind, was pure evil.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 696 (containing 3 segments):
  1. l lingered but a moment at the mirror: the second and
conclusive experiment had yet to be attempted; it yet remained
to be seen if l had lost my identity beyond redemption and must
flee before daylight from a house that was no longer mine; and
hurrying back to my cabinet, l once more prepared and drank
the cup, once more suffered the pangs of dissolution, and came
to myself once more with the character, the stature and the
face of Henry Jekyll.
  2. That night l had come to the fatal crossroads.
  3. Had l approached my discovery in a more noble spirit,
had l risked the experiment while under the empire of generous
or pious aspirations, all must have been otherwise, and from
these ago- nies of death and birth, l had come forth an angel
instead of a fiend.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 697 (containing 1 segments):
  1. The drug had no discriminating action; it was
neither diabolical nor divine; it but shook the doors of the
prisonhouse of my disposition; and like the captives of Philippi,
that which stood within ran forth.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 698 (containing 3 segments):
  1. At that time my virtue
slumbered; my evil, kept awake by ambition, was alert and swift
to seize the occasion; and the thing that was projected was
Edward Hyde.
  2. Hence, although l had now two characters as well
as two appearances, one was wholly evil, and the other was still
the old Henry Jekyll, that incongruous compound of whose
87
reformation and improvement l had already learned to despair.
  3. The movement was thus wholly toward the worse.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 699 (containing 4 segments):
  1. Even at that time, l had not conquered my aversions to the
dryness of a life of study.
  2. l would still be merrily disposed at
times; and as my pleasures were (to say the least) undignified,
and l was not only well known and highly considered, but
growing towards the elderly man, this incoherency of my life
was daily growing more unwelcome.
  3. lt was on this side that my
new power tempted me until l fell in slavery.
  4. l had but to drink
the cup, to doff at once the body of the noted professor, and to
assume, like a thick cloak, that of Edward Hyde.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 700 (containing 1 segments):
  1. l smiled at the
notion; it seemed to me at the time to be humourous; and l
made my preparations with the most studious care.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 701 (containing 1 segments):
  1. l took and
furnished that house in Soho, to which Hyde was tracked by the
police; and engaged as a housekeeper a creature whom l knew
well to be silent and unscru- pulous.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 702 (containing 3 segments):
  1. On the other side, l
announced to my servants that a Mr.
  2. Hyde (whom l described)
was to have full liberty and power about my house in the
square; and to parry mishaps, l even called and made myself a
familiar object, in my second character.
  3. l next drew up that will
to which you so much objected; so that if anything befell me in
the person of Or.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 703 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Jekyll, l could enter on that of Edward Hyde
without pecuniary loss.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 704 (containing 1 segments):
  1. And thus fortified, as l supposed, on
every side, l be- gan to profit by the strange immunities of my
position.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 705 (containing 1 segments):
  1. 88
Men have before hired bravos to transact their crimes, while
their own person and reputation sat under shelter.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 706 (containing 2 segments):
  1. l was the first
that ever did so for his pleasures.
  2. l was the first that could plod
in the public eye with a load of genial respectability, and in a
moment, like a schoolboy,
strip off these lendings and spring headlong into the sea of
liberty.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 707 (containing 1 segments):
  1. But for me, in my impenetrable mantle, the safely was
complete.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 708 (containing 2 segments):
  1. Think of it-l did not even exist! Let me but escape into
my laboratory door, give me but a second or two to mix and
swallow the draught that l had always standing ready; and
whatever he had done, Edward Hyde would pass away like the
stain of breath upon a mirror; and there in his stead, quietly at
home, trimming the midnight lamp in his study, a man who
could afford to laugh at suspicion, would be Henry Jekyll.
  2. The pleasures which l made haste to seek in my disguise were,
as l have said, undignified; l would scarce use a harder term.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 709 (containing 1 segments):
  1. But
in the hands of Edward Hyde, they soon began to turn toward
the mon- strous.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 710 (containing 2 segments):
  1. When l would come back from these
excursions, l was often plunged into a kind of wonder at my
vicarious depravity.
  2. This familiar that l called out of my own
soul, and sent forth alone to do his good pleasure, was a being
inherently malign and villainous; his every act and thought
centered on self; drinking pleasure with bestial avidity from any
degree of torture to another; relentless like a man of stone.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 711 (containing 3 segments):
  1. Henry Jekyll stood at times aghast before the acts of Edward
89
Hyde; but the situation was apart from ordinary laws, and
insidiously relaxed the grasp of conscience.
  2. lt was Hyde, after
all, and Hyde alone, that was guilty.
  3. Jekyll was no worse; he
woke again to his good qualities seem- ingly unimpaired; he
would even make haste, where it was possible, to undo the evil
done by Hyde.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 712 (containing 1 segments):
  1. And thus his conscience slumbered.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 713 (containing 2 segments):
  1. lnto the details of the infamy at which l thus connived (for even
now l can scarce grant that l committed it) l have no design of
enter- ing; l mean but to point out the warnings and the
successive steps with which my chastisement approached.
  2. l met
with one accident which, as it brought on no consequence, l
shall no more than men- tion.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 714 (containing 2 segments):
  1. An act of cruelty to a child
aroused against me the anger of a passer-by, whom l
recognised the other day in the person of your kins- man; the
doctor and the child's family joined him; there were mo- ments
when l feared for my life; and at last, in order to pacify their too
just resentment, Edward Hyde had to bring them to the door,
and pay them in a cheque drawn in the name of Henry Jekyll.
  2. But this danger was easily eliminated from the future, by
opening an account at an- other bank in the name of Edward
Hyde himself; and when, by slop- ing my own hand backward, l
had supplied my double with a signature, l thought l sat beyond the reach of fate.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 715 (containing 4 segments):
  1. 90
Some two months before the murder of Sir Oanvers, l had been
out for one of my adventures, had returned at a late hour, and
woke the next day in bed with somewhat odd sensations.
  2. lt was 
in vain l looked about me; in vain l saw the decent furniture and
tall proportions of my room in the square; in vain that l
recognised the pattern of the bed curtains and the design of the
mahogany frame; something still kept insisting that l was not
where l was, that l had not wakened where l seemed to be, but
in the little room in Soho where l was accustomed to sleep in the
body of Edward Hyde.
  3. l smiled to myself, and in my
psychological way, began lazily to inquire into the elements of
this illusion, occasionally, even as l did so, dropping back into a
comfort- able morning doze.
  4. l was still so engaged when, in one
of my more wakeful moments, my eyes fell upon my hand.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 716 (containing 2 segments):
  1. Now
the hand of Henry Jekyll (as you have often remarked) was
professional in shape and size: it was large, firm, white and
comely.
  2. But the hand which l now saw, clearly enough, in the
yellow light of a mid-London morning, lying half shut on the
bedclothes, was lean, corder, knuckly, of a dusky pal- lor and
thickly shaded with a swart growth of hair.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 717 (containing 1 segments):
  1. lt was the hand of
Edward Hyde.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 718 (containing 2 segments):
  1. l must have stared upon it for near half a minute, sunk as l was
in the mere stupidity of wonder, before terror woke up in my
breast as sudden and startling as the crash of cymbals; and
bounding from my bed l rushed to the mirror.
  2. At the sight that
met my eyes, my blood was changed into something exquisitely
91
thin and icy.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 719 (containing 4 segments):
  1. Yes, l had gone to bed Henry Jekyll, l had
awakened Edward Hyde.
  2. How was this to be explained? l asked
myself; and then, with another bound of terror- how was it to be
remedied? lt was well on in the morning; the servants were up;
all my drugs were in the cabinet-a long journey down two pairs
of stairs, through the back passage, across the open court and
through the anatomical theatre, from where l was then standing
hor- ror-struck.
  3. lt might indeed be possible to cover my face;
but of what use was that, when l was unable to conceal the
alteration in my stat- ure?
And then with an overpowering sweetness of relief, it came
back upon my mind that the servants were already used to the
coming and going of my second self.
  4. l had soon dressed, as well
as l was able, in
clothes of my own size: had soon passed through the house,
where Bradshaw stared and drew back at seeing Mr.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 720 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Hyde at
such an hour and in such a strange array; and ten minutes later,
Or.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 721 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Jekyll had re- turned to his own shape and was sitting down,
with a darkened brow, to make a feint of breakfasting.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 722 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Small indeed was my appetite.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 723 (containing 20 segments):
  1. This inexplicable incident, this reversal of my previous experience, seemed, like the Babylonian
finger on the wall, to be spelling out the letters of my judgment;
and l began to reflect more seriously than ever before on the
issues and possibili- ties of my double existence.
  2. That part of
92
me which l had the power of projecting, had lately been much
exercised and nourished; it had seemed to me of late as though
the body of Edward Hyde had grown in stature, as though
(when l wore that form) l were conscious of a more generous
tide of blood; and l began to spy a danger that, if this were
much prolonged, the balance of my nature might be
permanently overthrown, the power of voluntary change be
forfeited, and the char- acter of Edward Hyde become
irrevocably mine.
  3. The power of the drug had not been always
equally displayed.
  4. Once, very early in my career, it had totally
failed me; since then l had been obliged on more than one
occasion to double, and once, with infinite risk of death, to
treble the amount; and these rare uncertainties had cast
hitherto the sole shadow on my contentment.
  5. Now, however,
and in the light of that morning's accident, l was led to remark
that whereas, in the be- ginning, the difficulty had been to throw
off the body of Jekyll, it had of late gradually but decidedly
transferred itself to the other side.
  6. All things therefore seemed
to point to this; that l was slowly losing hold of my original and
better self, and becoming slowly incorporated with my second
and worse.
  7. Between these two, l now felt l had to choose.
  8. My two natures
had memory in common, but all other faculties were most
unequally shared between them.
  9. Jekyll (who was composite)
now with the most sensi- tive apprehensions, now with a greedy
gusto, projected and shared in the pleasures and adventures of
93
Hyde; but Hyde was indifferent to Jekyll, or but remembered
him as the mountain bandit remembers the cavern in which he
conceals himself from pursuit.
  10. Jekyll had more than a father's
interest; Hyde had more than a son's indifference.
  11. To cast in my
lot with Jekyll, was to die to those appetites which l had
long secretly indulged and had of late begun to pamper.
  12. To cast
it in with Hyde, was to die to a thousand interests and
aspirations, and to become, at a blow and forever, despised
and friendless.
  13. The bargain might appear unequal; but there
was still another consideration in the scales; for while Jekyll
would suffer smartingly in the fires of absti- nence, Hyde would
be not even conscious of all that he had lost.
  14. Strange as my
circumstances were, the terms of this debate are as old and
commonplace as man; much the same inducements and alarms
cast the die for any tempted and trembling sinner; and it fell out
with me, as it falls with so vast a majority of my fellows, that l
chose the better part and was found wanting in the strength to
keep to it.
  15. Yes, l preferred the elderly and discontented doctor, surrounded
by friends and cherishing honest hopes; and bade a resolute
farewell to the liberty, the comparative youth, the light step,
leaping impulses and secret pleasures, that l had enjoyed in the
disguise of Hyde.
  16. l made this choice perhaps with some
unconscious reservation, for l neither gave up the house in
Soho, nor destroyed the clothes of Edward Hyde, which still lay
94
ready in my cabinet.
  17. For two months, however, l was true to my
determination; for two months, l led a life of such severity as l
had never before attained to, and enjoyed the compensa- tions
of an approving conscience.
  18. But time began at last to obliterate
the freshness of my alarm; the praises of conscience began to
grow into a thing of course; l began to be tortured with throes
and longings, as of Hyde struggling after freedom; and at last,
in an hour of moral weakness, l once again compounded and
swallowed the transforming draught.
  19. l do not suppose that, when a drunkard reasons with himself
upon his vice, he is once out of five hundred times affected by
the dangers that he runs through his brutish, physical
insensibility; neither had l, long as l had considered my position,
made enough allowance for the complete moral insensibility
and insensate readiness to evil, which were the leading
characters of Edward Hyde.
  20. Yet it was by these that l was
punished.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 724 (containing 8 segments):
  1. My devil had been long caged, he came out roaring.
  2. l
was conscious, even when l took the draught, of a more
unbridled, a more furious propensity to ill.
  3. lt must have been
this, l suppose, that stirred in my soul that tempest of
impatience with which l listened to the civilities of my unhappy
victim; l declare, at least, before God, no
man morally sane could have been guilty of that crime upon so
pitiful a provocation; and that l struck in no more reasonable
spirit than that in which a sick child may break a plaything.
  4. But l
95
had voluntarily stripped myself of all those balancing instincts
by which even the worst of us continues to walk with some
degree of steadiness among tempta- tions; and in my case, to
be tempted, however slightly, was to fall.
  5. lnstantly the spirit of hell awoke in me and raged.
  6. With a
transport of glee, l mauled the unresisting body, tasting delight
from every blow; and it was not till weariness had begun to
succeed, that l was sud- denly, in the top fit of my delirium,
struck through the heart by a cold thrill of terror.
  7. A mist
dispersed; l saw my life to be forfeit; and fled from the scene of
these excesses, at once glorying and trembling, my lust of evil
gratified and stimulated, my love of life screwed to the topmost
peg.
  8. l ran to the house in Soho, and (to make assurance doubly sure) destroyed my papers; thence l set out through the
lamplit streets, in the same divided ecstasy of mind, gloating on
my crime, light-headedly devising others in the future, and yet
still hastening and still hearkening in my wake for the steps of
the avenger.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 725 (containing 2 segments):
  1. Hyde had a song upon his lips as he compounded
the draught, and as he drank it, pledged the dead man.
  2. The
pangs of transformation had not done tearing him, before
Henry Jekyll, with streaming tears of gratitude and remorse,
had fallen upon his knees and lifted his clasped hands to God.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 726 (containing 3 segments):
  1. The veil of self-indulgence was rent from head to foot.
  2. l saw my
life as a whole: l followed it up from the days of childhood, when
l had walked with my father's hand, and through the selfdenying toils of my professional life, to arrive again and again,       
96
with the same sense of unreality, at the damned horrors of the
evening.
  3. l could have screamed aloud; l sought with tears and
prayers to smother down the crowd of hideous images and
sounds with which my memory swarmed against me; and still,
between the petitions, the ugly face of my iniq- uity stared into
my soul.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 727 (containing 4 segments):
  1. As the acuteness of this remorse began to die away, it
was succeeded by a sense of joy.
  2. The problem of my conduct
was solved.
  3. Hyde was thenceforth impossible; whether l would
or not, l was now confined to the better part of my existence;
and O, how l rejoiced to think of it! with what willing humility l
embraced anew the restrictions of natural life! with what sincere
renunciation l locked the door by which l had so often gone and
come, and ground the key
under my heel!
The next day, came the news that the murder had been
overlooked, that the guilt of Hyde was patent to the world, and
that the victim was a man high in public estimation.
  4. lt was not
only a crime, it had been a tragic folly.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 728 (containing 2 segments):
  1. l think l was glad to know
it; l think l was glad to have my better impulses thus buttressed
and guarded by the terrors of the scaf- fold.
  2. Jekyll was now my
city of refuge; let but Hyde peep out an in- stant, and the hands
of all men would be raised to take and slay him.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 729 (containing 5 segments):
  1. l resolved in my
future conduct to redeem the past; and l can say with honesty
that my resolve was fruitful of some good.
  2. You know yourself
how earnestly, in the last months of the last year, l laboured to
97
relieve suffering; you know that much was done for others, and
that the days passed quietly, almost happily for myself.
  3. Nor can
l truly say that l wearied of this beneficent and innocent life; l
think instead that l daily enjoyed it more completely; but l was
still cursed with my dual- ity of purpose; and as the first edge of
my penitence wore off, the lower side of me, so long indulged,
so recently chained down, began to growl for licence.
  4. Not that l
dreamed of resuscitating Hyde; the bare idea of that would
startle me to frenzy: no, it was in my own person that l was once
more tempted to trifle with my conscience; and it was as an
ordinary secret sinner that l at last fell before the
assaults of temptation.
  5. There comes an end to all things; the most capacious measure
is filled at last; and this brief condescension to my evil finally
destroyed the balance of my soul.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 730 (containing 1 segments):
  1. And yet l was not alarmed;
the fall seemed natural, like a return to the old days before l had
made my discovery.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 731 (containing 1 segments):
  1. lt was a fine, clear, January day, wet under
foot where the frost had melted, but cloudless overhead; and
the Regent's Park was full of win- ter chirrupings and sweet with
spring odours.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 732 (containing 2 segments):
  1. l sat in the sun on a bench; the animal within me
licking the chops of memory; the spir- itual side a little drowsed,
promising subsequent penitence, but not yet moved to begin.
  2. After all, l reflected, l was like my neighbours; and then l smiled,
comparing myself with other men, comparing my active goodwill with the lazy cruelty of their neglect.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 733 (containing 3 segments):
  1. And at the very moment of that vainglorious thought, a qualm came over me, a
98
horrid nausea and the most deadly shuddering.
  2. These passed
away, and left me faint; and then as in its turn faintness
subsided, l began to be
aware of a change in the temper of my thoughts, a greater
boldness, a contempt of danger, a solution of the bonds of
obligation.
  3. l looked down; my clothes hung formlessly on my
shrunken limbs; the hand that lay on my knee was corded and
hairy.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 734 (containing 2 segments):
  1. l was once more Edward Hyde.
  2. A moment before l had
been safe of all men's respect, wealthy, beloved-the cloth laying
for me in the dining-room at home; and now l was the common
quarry of mankind, hunted, houseless, a known murderer, thrall
to the gallows.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 735 (containing 3 segments):
  1. My reason wavered, but it did not fail me utterly.
  2. l have more
than once observed that in my second character, my faculties
seemed sharp- ened to a point and my spirits more tensely
elastic; thus it came about that, where Jekyll perhaps might
have succumbed, Hyde rose to the importance of the moment.
  3. My drugs were in one of the presses of my cabinet; how was l to
reach them? That was the problem that (crush- ing my temples
in my hands) l set myself to solve.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 736 (containing 1 segments):
  1. The laboratory door l had
closed.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 737 (containing 1 segments):
  1. lf l sought to enter by the house, my own servants would
consign me to the gallows.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 738 (containing 1 segments):
  1. l saw l must employ another hand,
and thought of Lanyon.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 739 (containing 5 segments):
  1. How was he to be reached? how
persuaded? Sup- posing that l escaped capture in the streets,
how was l to make my way into his presence? and how should l,
99
an unknown and displeasing visitor, prevail on the famous
physician to rifle the study of his col- league, Or.
  2. Jekyll? Then l
remembered that of my original character, one part remained
to me: l could write my own hand; and once l had conceived that
kindling spark, the way that l must follow became lighted up
from end to end.
  3. Thereupon, l arranged my clothes as best l could, and
summoning a passing hansom, drove to an hotel in Portland
Street, the name of which l chanced to remember.
  4. At my
appearance (which was indeed comical enough, however tragic
a fate these garments covered) the driver could not conceal his
mirth.
  5. l gnashed my teeth upon him with a gust of devilish fury;
and the smile withered from his face-happily for him-yet more
happily for myself, for in another instant l had cer- tainly
dragged him from his perch.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 740 (containing 1 segments):
  1. At the inn, as l entered, l looked
about me with so black a countenance as made the attendants
trem- ble; not a look did they exchange in my presence; but
obsequiously took my orders, led me to a private room, and
brought me where- withal to write.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 741 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Hyde in danger of his life
was a creature new to me;
shaken with inordinate anger, strung to the pitch of murder,
lusting to inflict pain.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 742 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Yet the creature was astute; mastered his
fury with a great effort of the will; composed his two important
letters, one to Lanyon and one to Poole; and that he might
receive actual evidence of their being posted, sent them out
100
with directions that they should be registered.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 743 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Thenceforward,
he sat all day over the fire in the private room, gnawing his
nails; there he dined, sitting alone with his fears, the waiter
visibly quailing before his eye; and thence, when the night was
fully come, he set forth in the corner of a closed cab, and was
driven to and fro about the streets of the city.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 744 (containing 1 segments):
  1. He, l say-l cannot
say, l.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 745 (containing 1 segments):
  1. That child of Hell had nothing human; nothing lived in him
but fear and hatred.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 746 (containing 2 segments):
  1. And when at last, thinking the driver had
begun to grow suspicious, he discharged the cab and ventured
on foot, attired in his misfitting clothes, an object marked out
for observation, into the midst of the nocturnal passengers,
these two base passions raged within him like a tempest.
  2. He
walked fast, hunted by his fears, chattering to himself, skulking
through the less frequented thoroughfares, count- ing the
minutes that still divided him from midnight.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 747 (containing 1 segments):
  1. Once a woman
spoke to him, offering, l think, a box of lights.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 748 (containing 1 segments):
  1. He smote her in
the face, and she fled.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 749 (containing 3 segments):
  1. When l came to myself at Lanyon's, the horror of my old friend
perhaps affected me somewhat: l do not know; it was at least
but a drop in the sea to the abhorrence with which l looked back
upon these hours.
  2. A change had come over me.
  3. lt was no longer
the fear of the gallows, it was the horror of being Hyde that
racked me.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 750 (containing 11 segments):
  1. l received Lanyon's condemnation partly in a dream;
it was partly in a dream that l came home to my own house and
got into bed.
  2. l slept after the prostration of the day, with a
stringent and profound slumber which not even the nightmares
101
that wrung me could avail to break.
  3. l awoke in the morning
shaken, weakened, but refreshed.
  4. l still hated and feared the
thought of the brute that slept within me, and l had not of
course forgotten the appalling dangers of the day before; but l
was once more at home, in my own house and close to my
drugs; and gratitude for my escape shone so strong in my soul
that it almost ri- valled the brightness of hope.
  5. l was stepping leisurely across the court after breakfast,
drinking the chill of the air with pleasure, when l was seized
again with those indescribable sensations that heralded the change; and l had but
the time to gain the shelter of my cabinet, before l was once
again raging and freezing with the passions of Hyde.
  6. lt took on
this occasion a double dose to recall me to myself; and alas! six
hours after, as l sat looking sadly in the fire, the pangs returned,
and the drug had to be re-admin- istered.
  7. ln short, from that
day forth it seemed only by a great effort as of gymnastics, and
only under the immediate stimulation of the drug, that l was
able to wear the countenance of Jekyll.
  8. At all hours of the day
and night, l would be taken with the premonitory shudder;
above all, if l slept, or even dozed for a moment in my chair, it
was always as Hyde that l awakened.
  9. Under the strain of this
continually impending doom and by the sleeplessness to which l
now condemned myself, ay, even beyond what l had thought
possible to man, l became, in my own person, a creature eaten
102
up and emptied by fever, languidly weak both in body and
mind, and solely occupied by one thought: the horror of my
other self.
  10. But when l slept, or when the virtue of the medicine
wore off, l would leap almost without transition (for the pangs
of transformation grew daily less marked) into the possession
of a fancy brimming with images of terror, a soul boiling with
causeless hatreds, and a body that seemed not strong enough
to contain the raging energies of life.
  11. The powers of Hyde
seemed to have grown with the sickliness of Jekyll.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 751 (containing 1 segments):
  1. And
certainly the hate that now divided them was equal on each
side.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 752 (containing 4 segments):
  1. With Jekyll, it was a thing of vital in- stinct.
  2. He had now
seen the full deformity of that creature that shared with him
some of the phenomena of consciousness, and was co-heir with
him to death: and beyond these links of community, which in
themselves made the most poignant part of his distress, he
thought of Hyde, for all his energy of life, as of something not
only hellish but inorganic.
  3. This was the shocking thing; that the
slime of the pit seemed to utter cries and voices; that the
amorphous dust gesticulated and sinned; that what was dead,
and had no shape, should usurp the of- fices of life.
  4. And this
again, that that insurgent horror was knit to him closer than a
wife, closer than an eye; lay caged in his flesh, where he heard it
mutter and felt it struggle to be born; and at every hour of
weakness, and in the confidence of slumber, prevailed against
him, and deposed him out of life.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 753 (containing 5 segments):
  1. The hatred of Hyde for Jekyll
was of a different order.
  2. His terror of the gallows drove him
continually to com103
mit temporary suicide, and return to his subordinate station of a
part instead of a person; but he loathed the necessity, he
loathed the de- spondency into which Jekyll was now fallen, and
he resented the dis- like with which he was himself regarded.
  3. Hence the ape-like tricks that he would play me, scrawling in my
own hand blasphemies on the pages of my books, burning the
letters and destroying the portrait of my father; and indeed, had
it not been for his fear of death, he would long ago have ruined
himself in order to involve me in the ruin.
  4. But his love of me is
wonderful; l go further: l, who sicken and freeze at the mere
thought of him, when l recall the abjection and passion of this
attachment, and when l know how he fears my power to cut him
off by suicide, l find it in my heart to pity him.
  5. lt is useless, and the time awfully fails me, to prolong this
descrip- tion; no one has ever suffered such torments, let that
suffice; and yet even to these, habit brought-no, not alleviationbut a certain cal- lousness of soul, a certain acquiescence of 
despair; and my punish- ment might have gone on for years,
but for the last calamity which has now fallen, and which has
finally severed me from my own face and nature.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 754 (containing 3 segments):
  1. My provision
of the salt, which had never been renewed since the date of the
first experiment, began to run low.
  2. l sent out for a fresh supply
and mixed the draught; the ebullition followed, and the first
change of colour, not the second; l drank it and it was without
effi- ciency.
  3. You will learn from Poole how l have had London
104
ransacked; it was in vain; and l am now persuaded that my first
supply was im- pure, and that it was that unknown impurity
which lent efficacy to the draught.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 755 (containing 2 segments):
  1. About a week has passed, and l am now finishing this statement
under the influence of the last of the old powders.
  2. This, then, is
the last time, short of a miracle, that Henry Jekyll can think his
own thoughts or see his own face (now how sadly altered!) in
the glass.
------------------------------------------------------------
Semantic Chunk Group 756 (containing 3 segments):
  1. Nor must l delay too long to bring my writing to an
end; for if my narrative has hitherto escaped destruction, it has
been by a combination of great prudence and great good luck.
  2. Should the throes of change take me in the act of writing it,
Hyde will tear it in pieces; but if some time shall have elapsed
after l have laid it by, his wonderful selfishness and
circumscription to the moment will probably save it once again
from the action of his ape-like spite.
  3. And indeed the doom that
is closing
on us both has already changed and crushed him.

earthly refuge) and give ear to every sound of menace.

Hyde die upon the scaffold? or will he find courage to release
